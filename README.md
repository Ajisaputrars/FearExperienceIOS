### **Project Overview**

![][image-2]
This is a simple app to deliver fear experience using audio-visual. The media we chose is video because it is easier to produce in short time frame. 

Before launching into Main Screen, the Warning Screen will appear to give you a warning. This app will contain scary and terrifying videos which can (maybe) give you heart attack.

Main Screen shows video list which you can choose. You can play the video directly by pressing Play button. You can also view the detail by tapping the list and it will show you Detail Screen.

All of the content in this app is original content made by our group. So, you will not find this so-unique experience from other place. Enjoy it!
